GROWTH MINDSET

https://github.com/luketurnerdev/growth-mindset


DESCRIPTION OF APP

Growth Mindset is a mental health journaling app that lets users 'check in' and rate their levels of anxiety as well as allowing them to enter longer, free-form style journal entries. The user is provided with a random mental health tip if their mental state is getting worse, and encouragement if they are getting better.

PROJECT AIMS / MISSION STATEMENT

The aim of Growth Mindset is to provide a long-term journal for users suffering from mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. It can sometimes be hard to get an accurate perspective on your mental health over time, and a journaling app such as this one can provide a long-term snapshot of how your mental state has been progressing.

USER STORIES

The following are user stories that we had in mind while designing this project.

FUNCTIONALITY

    The user enters the app and is greeted and asked for their name. They are then presented with a main menu, in which they can choose from the following options :

    1) Anxiety log

        By choosing this option, the app then asks the user to rate their current level of anxiety on a scale of 1-10. The first time this is run, the recorded score is displayed, and the user is returned to the main menu. Every time after this, a comparison is made, in which the value given and the previous value given are compared. If the user is less anxious before, they are congratulated. If not, they are asked if they would like to receive a mental health tip. If the user selects yes, they are given a tip selected randomly from a pre-defined list. They are then returned to the main menu.

    2) Journal Entry
        
        The user is asked if they would like to submit a new journal entry, or view their past entries. If the user opts for a new entry, they are prompted to type their message. This is then stored and can be retrieved by selecting the second option, along with any previous entries they may have had stored.

    3) Resources

        The resources option [.........]

    4) Exit

        The user is given a goodbye message and the app terminates.


INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

A) Cloning from github

B) Running the file locally (downloaded zip folder)

As a command-line interface project, the app is controlled entirely with the keyboard, by typing commands. In most instances, there are multiple ways of entering data (either through numbers or the words of the options).

    1. Ensure you have the current version of Ruby installed (2.6.0 at time of writing). If not, instructions and downloads can be found here (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).

    2. Navigate to the directory containing your copy of growth_mindset.rb using [cd [directory]], and run it by typing [ruby growth_mindset.rb].

    3. You will be greeted, and asked for your name. Enter your name.

    4. You are now in the main menu. You may type numbers (1,2,3 or 4) or type the words 'anxiety', 'journal', 'resources' or 'exit',  whatever you prefer (case is accounted for). Other inputs will return an error.

    5. The app is controlled in the same way throughout the program, using the same typing conventions as explained above.

    6. You may exit the app at any time by either selecting the exit option from the main menu, or simply pressing CMD+C (CTRL+C on windows) to exit the application.

DESIGN AND PLANNING PROCESS

    1. Initial brainstorm   

Initally, I (Luke) sat down and brainstormed a lot of different ideas for an app. My intention was to have a free-flowing thought process in which no idea a bad idea. A lot of the ideas had to be abandoned due to scope (there are only 2 days to work on the app), but this 'judgement-free' style of brainstorming worked well for creating ideas.
